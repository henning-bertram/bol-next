The novelist Heinrich Mann resided a few blocks away, on Montana Avenue. The screenwriter Salka Viertel held gatherings on Mabery Road, near the Santa Monica beach. Alfred D\u00f6blin, the author of \u201cBerlin Alexanderplatz,\u201d had a place on Citrus Avenue, in Hollywood. His colleague Lion Feuchtwanger occupied the Villa Aurora, a Spanish-style mansion overlooking the Pacific; among its amusements was a Hitler dartboard. Vicki Baum, whose novel \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d brought her a screenwriting career, had a house on Amalfi Drive, near the leftist composer Hanns Eisler. Alma Mahler-Werfel, the widow of Gustav Mahler, lived with her third husband, the best-selling Austrian writer Franz Werfel, on North Bedford Drive, next door to the conductor Bruno Walter. Elisabeth Hauptmann, the co-author of \u201cThe Threepenny Opera,\u201d lived in Mandeville Canyon, at the actor Peter Lorre\u2019s ranch. The philosopher Theodor\u00a0W. Adorno rented a duplex apartment on Kenter Avenue, meeting with Max Horkheimer, who lived nearby, to write the post-Marxist jeremiad \u201cDialectic of Enlightenment.\u201d At a suitably lofty remove, on San Remo Drive, was Thomas Mann, Heinrich\u2019s brother, the august author of \u201cThe Magic Mountain.\u201d\""

The financing of Hudson Yards was done through private capital but also speculative capital, so there was debt involved. But not any kind of debt, a specific debt: commercial mortgage-backed securities. So, all of that is to say that what makes the restaurant industry possible is maybe different from, say, the airline industry, or mining, or some shit.
